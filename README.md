# HomeworkGrader

## Vision

The **HomeworkGrader** smart contract automates the process of grading homework submissions and rewarding students with cryptocurrency (Ether) based on their performance. 
This decentralized approach aims to create a transparent, fair, and incentivized learning environment where students are motivated to perform their best, knowing that their efforts will be rewarded directly and automatically.
